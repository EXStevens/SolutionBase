# Welcome to Solution Base

Solution Base houses the experiences of my CS exploration and study notes, all written in a commonly-understandable style. Most of them are tested on Rocky Linux 9, the platform I am using. Use the sidebar to explore topics or jump to specific guides. Hope you'll like it.

## What’s inside this site?

- **Concept explanations**  
  Straightforward notes that break down key CS ideas in a friendly and readable way.

- **Practical guides**  
  Setup instructions, environment notes, and small “fix lists” for common issues.

- **Project documentation**  
  Overviews, design decisions, references, and internal notes for things I’m building.

- **“What’s Up?” updates**  
  A lightweight space for small announcements, personal notes, reflections, or anything I feel like writing at the moment.

## Quick links

- Navigate to **Getting started** to set up your local environment.
- Visit the **What's up?** from the top navigation bar for some updates and small thoughts I consider worth sharing.

Happy exploring!
